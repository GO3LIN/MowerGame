# MowerGame

The application is built with Node.JS with ES6 features with the help of Babel.

The prerequisites are of course NodeJS and a terminal (joke).

This project has 0 dependencies !!!


## Install dev-dependencies

Go to the project directory and run the install command:

`npm install`



## Run the app

The test file is located in the src folder. There's already the example test file in that folder, so you will just have to run:

- For development: `npm run start:dev`.

This command launchs the nodemon daemon to track changes and update the app automagically.

- For running once: `npm start`.

Enjoy :-)
